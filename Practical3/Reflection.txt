In the Practical3, I finish all the work.
In the class, I met many challenges like how to change the theme of my own website and how to delete the file on github.
But after collaboration with my classmates and Rob's guidance, I have already overcome the challenges.
I feel a sense of accomplishment because I master a new skill!
I will keep working hard to be a good bioinformatics worker!
