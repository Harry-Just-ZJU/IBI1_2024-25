## The commit messages were not very informative, e.g. said "add" but did not say what was added

So I change the commit message to 'add introduction', 'add reflection', 'revision after feedback'

## The answer is mostly correct, but you didn't mention it was numbers between 1 and 6

So I change my answer to be more clear: 'to stimulate generate two numbers randomly from 1 to 6 at the same time repeatedly, and output how many time it needs to get the same number.'
