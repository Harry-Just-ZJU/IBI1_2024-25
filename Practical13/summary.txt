• The alignment score and percentage of identical amino	acids for each of the three	comparisons	
that you performed using Python.

P04179 vs P09671:
Score: 1097.0
Identity: 90.09%

P04179 vs random:
Score: -234.0
Identity: 4.95%

P09671 vs random:
Score: -230.0
Identity: 5.41%

• A	statement recording	which of these two sequences are most closely related.

Among these sequences, P04179 and P09671 are the most closely related. 
This is because the alignment score between P04179 and P09671 is 1097.0 with an identity percentage of 90.09%, 
which is significantly higher than the scores and identities between either P04179 or P09671 and the random sequence. 
The scores for the comparisons with the random sequence are -234.0 and -230.0, 
and the identity percentages are 4.95% and 5.41% respectively. 
Higher alignment scores and identity percentages indicate a greater similarity in amino acid composition, 
suggesting a closer relationship between P04179 and P09671.
