Compared to the previous practical, the practical today is quite difficult but interesting.

I've learnt how to read long requirement and code according to that.
And the process of debugging is interesting, I can slowly find where I'm wrong and revise again and again, that's really interesting.
And sometimes I came across some problem I think is unreasonable, then I discussed with my classmates, that's really interesting.
